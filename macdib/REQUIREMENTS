The code is known to compile under PPC Mac OS X 10.4.11 with Xcode 2.5.
Compiling in any other environment is unlikely to work without modifying
the Makefile.

You will need GTK library binaries.
Extract gtk-ppc-bin-2011-10-25.tar.bz2 into /Users/gtk-ppc and
gtk-x86-bin-2011-11-04.tar.bz2 into /Users/gtk-x86
These *.bz2 files are found in the
/Source_Code/Library_Binaries_and_Source/MacOSX/ directory of the driver CD-ROM.

You will also need Mattias Ellert's libusb 0.1.13 beta 2009-09-10. Do not
try to use libusb 0.1.12, version 0.1.12 is not compatible with Cocoa and
will make MacDIB break in bizarre ways.
Extract libusb.pkg.tar.gz from the driver CD-ROM and place libusb.pkg
in the dib directory, then cd to libusb.pkg/Contents and run
"gzip -dc Archive.pax.gz | pax -r".

ige-mac-bundler 0.5 should be installed in ~/bin and ~/bin should be in
your $PATH.
